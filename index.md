# Community Gatherings

## Do you want to organize a Gathering for your local Community?

Community Gatherings are important events to share learning and knowledge with your communities and align your plans and ideas with Mozilla's goals. Community Gatherings had a set of common goals:

- Align Mozilla’s community with Mozilla’s goals
- Improve mozillians’ team and individual skills

## Code of Conduct

We are a diverse community, and we want that all Community Gatherings follow the [Community Guidelines](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/participation/). All meetings under this format, should adapt our Code of Conduct from any of our gatherings that you can find in our wiki (like this one from the [Arabic Gathering](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Participation/Community_Gatherings/Arabic_Gathering_2016/Code_of_Conduct))
