# Community Gatherings


## Do you want to organize a Gathering for your local Community?

Community Gatherings are important events to share learning and knowledge with your communities and align your plans and ideas with Mozilla's goals. Community Gatherings had a set of common goals:

- Align Mozilla’s community with Mozilla’s goals
- Improve mozillians’ team and individual skills
